# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Use case implemented:

1. React
2. Typescript
3. Using local storage
4. Dynamic Carousel
5. Table with data
6. Responsivnes until 454px
7. Create, View, Detele, Delete All - Crud
8. Search
9. Notifications - toastify
10. Routes
11. Recipe design

# Run the code:

1. select folder and open terminal
2. npm install
3. npm start (http://localhost:3000 )
4. add first recipe
5. for images use link like this: https://i.imgur.com/b6jR7Ls.jpeg

# Architecture

public - locales - for translation
src- types- interfaces for TS
src- assets - for images
src- model - interface of recipe
src- slider - slider

# Things still needs to be done:

1. responsive design until 350px for mobitels
2. rewrite app from css to scss
3. better design (maybe to use MUI)
4. translation
5. tests
6. better favicon
7. edit contact for full crude...

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
